## **Introduction**

This article focuses on bootstrapping a react template using Webpack. CLI Tools
such as create-react-app, next, Vue CLI, etc provide phenomenal configuration
out of the box through which one can generate a project with sane defaults. That
being said, seeing how things work under the hood is helpful in light of the
fact that sometimes you'll have to make some changes to the defaults. In this
article, we'll try to comprehend what webpack is, the way it is valuable and the
different things that we can manage with webpack. Alongside this, we'll assemble
our own personal React template totally from scratch with a fancy feature of
code splitting!

## **What is Webpack?**

Webpack was announced roughly 6 years ago with it releasing its 5th version - v5
in October of 2020. Webpack 1,2,3 kind of built on the backs of one another
whereas Webpack 4 was a complete rewrite from the ground up. So a lot of the
plugins that worked with the earlier version, none of them really worked when
you moved to v4. Saying this I should say that Webpack 4 and 5 are super quick
and performant and can do plenty of cool things with all the new plugins and
features. It has gotten over 40k stars on Github. So, what exactly is Webpack?
Webpack is an open-source Javascript module bundler.

## **What is a module bundler?**

A module bundler basically builds your dependency tree. So if you were just
building a static website you were probably really familiar with either a link
tag at the top or a script tag at the bottom. So if you're building a really
complex application or a really complex site you're probably used to at this
point having to kind of order those link tags or script tags in a specific
order. You want the most important thing to be loaded faster and the thing that
is dependant upon everything else to be loaded may be more towards the bottom.
The job of a module bundler is to build a graph/tree of all the dependencies.
Its job is to go through your files and sniff the stuff out to understand what
is dependent upon what and once it understands that, it builds this tree/graph
and it understands the relationship between one file and the other. It handles
all the import statements at the top, the export statements at the bottom, those
statements is how the module bundler builds the tree. The next thing it does is
create static assets or in other senses, it flattens the files. Sometimes it
will minify them or uglify them or concatenate them into one file. In this
article, we are going to talk about how not to concatenate them into one big
file and maybe split them into various smaller chunks. Since it creates static
assets, we can use things like es6, typescript, sass or all of these languages
that are built upon the technologies that we know but the browser isn't there
yet. The special thing about this bundler is that it is specifically for
javascript but we can use plugins for HTML/CSS. The beauty of Webpack is that it
is a Javascript module bundler that you can use for any javascript application
like React, AngularJs, Angular, Vue or even Node!

## **What is code splitting?**

The process of splitting your code into smaller chunks so that you only load
what you need when you need it. Webpack also has this process called Tree
shaking. So it might happen sometimes that you have imported something at the
top of your file and haven't used it. If you are using a linter then it might
catch it but if for some reason the linter doesn't catch it then webpack will
analyse it and remove it off when bundling the code. So tree shaking comes out
of the box with webpack but code-splitting needs some work. There are 2 styles
or approaches for code splitting.

- My code vs vendor code. (vendor code is nothing but npm. Anything that we
  download from a third party.)
- Chunking my code at a router level

## **Why should you learn webpack?**

As I said earlier, it's always good to know how things work under the hood
because someday you might have to make changes to the default settings. Adding
on to this, you can use webpack any of your javascript projects, no matter the
framework or library. Node, React, Angular, Vue, Typescript, etc, you can
configure your project with webpack. In simpler terms, the following line may
explain why use webpack?

`webpack = bower + grunt + gulp + browserify + browser-sync`

Webpack is a one-stop solution for all the different libraries that you have
used in the past. Also if you see the trends for webpack vs gulp vs grunt,
webpack beats them all by a huge margin. Check out the graph below.

[![NPM Trends: Webpack v/s Gulp v/s Grunt][./repoimages/npmtrends.png]](https://www.npmtrends.com/gulp-vs-next-vs-webpack-vs-grunt)

[https://www.npmtrends.com/gulp-vs-next-vs-webpack-vs-grunt](https://www.npmtrends.com/gulp-vs-next-vs-webpack-vs-grunt)

With such huge number of people using webpack you also get to have have a huge
community to help you around.

## **What is babel? Why do we need babel?**

The current version of React uses ES6 to ES8 syntax. We need Babel to compile
the code written in those syntaxes back to code the browser can understand.
Babel is there to ensure backward compatibility, awesome right? We can write our
code in the newer cleaner syntaxes and have Babel worry about the rest. First we
have to install a couple of dependencies and create a babel config file

```bash
touch babel.config.json

yarn add -D @babel/core @babel/polyfill @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react babel-core babel-loader babel-cli babel-polyfill babel-preset-react
```

```json
// babel.config.json

{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"]
}
```

## **React Application**

I have set up a very basic react application with some routes using the
react-router-dom library. I have also used React Loadable to achieve the Router
level code splitting. Following is the react code (Router setup, the rest is
plain good old react.)

```jsx
import React from 'react';

// Libraries
import {Router, Route, Switch, Redirect} from 'react-router-dom';
import Loadable from 'react-loadable';

// Components
import ActivityIndicator from '../components/shared/ActivityIndicator';

// Helpers
import createBrowserHistory from '../utils/history';

// Asynchronous Loading of Pages in different chunks
const AsyncHome = Loadable({
  loader: () => import('./Home'),
  loading: ActivityIndicator,
});

const AsyncAbout = Loadable({
  loader: () => import('./Home'),
  loading: ActivityIndicator,
});

function App() {
  return (
    <Router history={createBrowserHistory}>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/" exact component={AsyncHome} />
        <Route path="/about" exact component={AsyncAbout} />
        <Redirect to="/" />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- A basic router configuration is set up using the React Router DOM library.
- ActivityLoader is nothing but a fancy loader (spinner)
- We have made use of React Loadable library. It provides a function that
  requires 2 parameters, the first being what you want to load and the other
  being a loader element that you want to show when the chunk is being
  downloaded.

## **Let's set webpack up!**

People tend to have multiple webpack files, one for development, one for
production, one for testing and many more. How I like to do it is, maintain just
one file and export a function from it that handles all the cases. As you can
see from below, I'm passing an environment variable from my scripts which
determines which mode I am in and configures webpack accordingly. Nice and
simple, isn't it?

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:dev": "webpack --env development",
    "build:prod": "webpack -p --env production",
    "develop": "webpack-dev-server --env development",
    "start": "node server/server.js"
  }
}
```

You will be using a package called webpack-dev-server which is basically a
client-side server with the ability to live reload solely for development
purposes. So in your webpack file, you'll be exporting a function that has a
parameter called `env` which is populated through the script. Using this
parameter you'll be determining the environment which is then stored in
variables called `isDev` and `isProd`.

```jsx
// webpack.config.js file
module.exports = (env) => {
  console.log('WEBPACK ENV: ", env);

  const isProd = env === 'production';
  const isDev = env === 'development';
}
```

The next few steps are configuring the plugins and setting up other things that
we'll be using. Our setup will be divided into 3 major parts:

1. Plugins Setup: Webpack supports a plethora of different plugins which we can
   use to configure a certain task.
2. General config: Configuration that is common to all the environments.
3. Env specific config: Configuration particular to one environment - in our
   case, it is development and production.

## **Plugin Setup**

1. Setup support for environment variables.

- First, install a package called dotenv. Dotenv is used to parse the content of
  env files and present it as an object with keys and values.

```jsx
yarn add dotenv
```

- Following is the code that configures the support for env variables. So we get
  the keys and values from the file and store them under envVars variables. We
  also manually set the NODE_ENV variable.

```jsx
let envVars;

envVars = dotenv.config().parsed || {};
envVars.NODE_ENV = env;
```

- Next we loop through the envVars object and prefix each key with `process.env`

```jsx
// reduce it to a nice object, the same as before
const envKeys = Object.keys(envVars).reduce((prev, next) => {
  prev[`process.env.${next}`] = JSON.stringify(envVars[next]);
  return prev;
}, {});
```

- Once we have our final object up and ready, we configure it with webpack.

```jsx
// Maps environment variables from .env file to the project
const DefinePlugin = new webpack.DefinePlugin(envKeys);
```

1. Clean Plugin

- The clean plugin basically clears your output folder before building the new
  copy into it.

```jsx
yarn add -D clean-webpack-plugin
```

```jsx
const {CleanWebpackPlugin} = require('clean-webpack-plugin');

// Cleans 'dist' folder everytime before a new build
const CleanPlugin = new CleanWebpackPlugin({
  root: __dirname,
  verbose: true,
  dry: false,
});
```

- The `root` is basically the location where the output folder is going to be.
  Enabling `verbose` writes logs to the console. `dry` simulates the removal of
  files. (which we don't want)

1. Analyzer Plugin

- One of the cool plugins out there. It creates a page that visualises the size
  of webpack output files with an interactive zoomable tree-map.

```jsx
yarn add -D webpack-bundle-analyzer
```

```jsx
const {BundleAnalyzerPlugin} = require('webpack-bundle-analyzer');

// Plugin to generate a bundle map with sizes
const AnalyzerPlugin = new BundleAnalyzerPlugin({
  analyzerMode: 'static', // Set to 'disabled' if you dont want to visualize the output
});
```

1. HTML Plugin

- If you don't have this, none of this will work. So we have a template HTML
  file that is used by webpack. Since we have code splitting in our project,
  it'll dynamically import the script tags accordingly.

```jsx
yarn add -D html-webpack-plugin
```

```jsx
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

const HTMLPlugin = new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
  template: 'template.html',
  chunksSortMode: 'none',
  favicon: './src/assets/static/favicon.ico',
});
```

1. Copy Plugin

- A handy little plugin which after configuring copies all the static files into
  the build folder.

```jsx
yarn add -D copy-webpack-plugin
```

```jsx
const CopyWebpackPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin');

// Plugin to copy assets/static directory to the build
const CopyPlugin = new CopyWebpackPlugin({
  patterns: [{from: './src/assets/static', to: '.'}],
});
```

## **General Config: Lets build webpack!**

Alright! We have all our plugins configured! It's now time to build our webpack
configuration! In this part, we'll be creating a config object that is returned
by our configuration function which configures webpack. Let's start with
creating an empty object which we'll keep on populating.

```jsx
const config = {};
```

1. Entry: Webpack needs the path of the file from where the project is started.
   We are multiple entries (2 in our case - babel-polyfill and srx/index.js)
   which creates what is known as a "multi-main entry". This is useful when you
   would like to inject multiple dependent files together and graph their
   dependencies into one "chunk".

```jsx
config.entry = ['babel-polyfill', './src/index.js'];
```

1. Output: Configuring the output configuration options tells webpack how to
   write the compiled files to disk. Note that, while there can be multiple
   entry points, only one output configuration is specified.

```jsx
config.output = {
  path: path.join(__dirname, '/dist'),
  filename: 'bundle.js',
};
```

1. Optimisation: Here's where the magic happens! Here's the code, we'll go
   through it.

```jsx
config.optimization = {
  splitChunks: {
    cacheGroups: {
      commons: {
        test: /[\\]node_modules[\\]/,
        name: 'vendor',
        chunks: 'initial',
      },
    },
  },
  runtimeChunk: {
    name: 'manifest',
  },
  minimizer: [
    new UglifyJsPlugin({
      sourceMap: false,
      uglifyOptions: {
        ecma: 8,
        mangle: false,
        keep_classnames: true,
        keep_fnames: true,
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

- If you remember, earlier we had discussed what vendor is. The vendor is
  basically `npm` or any third-party code that we have used. All of my vendor
  code I want to chuck into one initial block. And so they will all get loaded
  into one group and be loaded into the frontend one time. This file is then
  cached into your browser thereby reducing the size for download substantially
  after the first load.
- If in future we make some updates and add new vendor code, the chunk file name
  will change which the browser would recognize and then discard the cached file
  and update it with the new one.
- You can consider our chunks being divided into 3 main categories. The first is
  the vendor one, the second is the chunk for each route (as per our loadable
  components) and the third one is the one that runtime handles. So our app
  requires some initial configuration before even loading the home page.
  RuntimeChunk handles the code chunk required for this configuration.
- Minimizer is just the way how we are planning to compress our files.

1. Plugins: An array containing all the plugins that we specified above.

```jsx
config.plugins = [
  CleanPlugin,
  AnalyzerPlugin,
  HTMLPlugin,
  CopyPlugin,
  DefinePlugin,
];
```

1. Loaders: Loaders are transformations that are applied to the source code of a
   module. They allow you to pre-process files as you import or “load” them.
   Thus, loaders are kind of like “tasks” in other build tools and provide a
   powerful way to handle front-end build steps. Loaders can transform files
   from a different language (like TypeScript) to JavaScript or load inline
   images as data URLs. Loaders even allow you to do things like import CSS
   files directly from your JavaScript modules!

```jsx
yarn add -D babel-loader file-loader html-loader style-loader css-loader
```

```jsx
config.module = {
  rules: [
    {
      test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
      loader: 'babel-loader',
      exclude: /node_modules/,
    },
    {
      test: /\.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg|woff|woff2|ttf|cot)$/,
      loader: 'file-loader',
    },
    {
      test: /\.html$/,
      loader: 'html-loader',
    },
    {
      test: /\.(css|scss)$/i,
      use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],
    },
  ],
};
```

1. Resolve: These options change how modules are resolved. webpack provides
   reasonable defaults, but it is possible to change the resolving in detail.
   Have a look at Module Resolution for more explanation of how the resolver
   works.

```jsx
config.resolve = {
  extensions: ['.js', '.jsx'],
};
```

## **Environment Special Config**

1. Production

```jsx
if (isProduction) {
  config.output = {
    chunkFilename: '[name].[chunkhash].bundle.js',
    filename: '[name].[chunkhash].bundle.js',
    path: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),
  };

  config.mode = 'production';
}
```

- Here we are reconfiguring the output setup. The name of the chunkfile will now
  include a hash which help in updating the browser cash. That is, if any chunk
  is updated with the new code, the file name will contain a different hash
  which would then be considered as a new file by the browser thereby flushing
  the previous file and updating it with the new one. For production ready apps
  this is a must. We can continue without this in development.
- The bundling mode is set to production which then webpack internally creates a
  production ready code.

1. Development

```jsx
if (isDev) {
  config.output = {
    path: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),
    chunkFilename: '[name].bundle.js',
    filename: '[name].bundle.js',
  };

  config.mode = 'development';
  config.devtool = 'inline-source-map';
  config.devServer = {
    contentBase: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),
    historyApiFallback: true,
    open: true,
  };
}
```

- For Development, we are using webpack-dev-server to serves the files locally.
- When webpack bundles your source code, it can become difficult to track down
  errors and warnings to their original location. For example, if you bundle
  three source files (a.js, b.js, and c.js) into one bundle (bundle.js) and one
  of the source files contains an error, the stack trace will point to
  bundle.js. This isn't always helpful as you probably want to know exactly
  which source file the error came from.
- In order to make it easier to track down errors and warnings, JavaScript
  offers source maps, which map your compiled code back to your original source
  code. If an error originates from b.js, the source map will tell you exactly
  that.
- For this guide, let's use the inline-source-map option, which is good for
  illustrative purposes.
- The dev server configurations will configure webpack-dev-server.

## **Wrapping up**

So that's it! You have set up your React project with webpack successfully! We
have covered the basics of webpack, its config, plugins and code-splitting. I
have set up a complete React Template with other features such as linting and
code formatting. You can check out the
template [here](https://github.com/riteshsp2000/react-boilerplate). Feel free to
use and customise it!

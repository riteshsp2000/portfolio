## **Introduction**

This article will look at one of the most frequent issues that arise when using
Typescript and MongoDB to build a GraphQL-based backend. Before we get started,
let's have a look at the primary technologies we'll be dealing with.

- Typescript is an open-source language that builds on JavaScript by adding
  static type definitions. Types provide a way to describe the shape of an
  object, providing better documentation and allowing TypeScript to validate
  that your code is working correctly.
- GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those
  queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and
  understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to
  ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve
  APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools.

## **Prerequisites**

The article assumes that you have a working knowledge of TypeScript, MongoDB,
GraphQL and Node.js. Before you begin, you will need:

1. A GraphQL server setup with your Node server (famous examples include
   Apollo-Server, Express-GraphQL)
2. MongoDB setup with your server. (Either local DB or MongoDB Atlas)

## **The Problem: Multiple Sources of Truth**

Most of the production level code these days is written in Typescript owing to
its phenomenal type system. Adding GraphQL to this, we can leverage all its
benefits such as having a client-driven API, preventing any over-fetching or
under fetching of data, reducing the number of API calls, static typing etc.
However, the initial boilerplate code quickly increases when a database comes
into the mix. You’ll quickly find yourself maintaining three type definitions
for one schema which then creates multiple sources of truth.

The following example shows a Mongoose schema, an Interface (type definition)
for the schema, and the corresponding GraphQL type definition

```tsx
// ================ User.ts ================
// Typescript Interface Definition
export interface IUser {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  username: string;
  password: string;
  articles: string[];
}

// MongoDB, Mongoose Schema definition
const useSchema = new Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  username: {
    type: String,
    required: false,
    unique,
    default: generateUserName(),
  },
  password: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  articles: [
    {
      type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      required: false,
    },
  ],
});

export const UserModel = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

// GraphQL Type Definition (either one works)
export const types = gql`
  type User {
    id: ID
    name: String
    email: String
    userName: String
    password: String
    articles: [Article]
  }
`;
```

## **The Solution: Single Source of Truth**

By single source of truth, what I mean is, it would be really great if we could
have a single definition for each schema. A single file that needs to be changed
to make any updates in the future. To maintain a single source of truth, there
exist multiple libraries such as TypeGraphQL, GraphQL Nexus, TypeORM, Typegoose
etc. In this guide, we’ll be using TypeGraphQL as GraphQL Nexus is not well
maintained. TypeORM is well suited for Relational Databases and it has some
compatibility issues with MongoDB which makes Typegoose as our choice.

## **Installations and Setup**

1. Package installations.

```bash
yarn add type-graphql reflect-metadata
```

1. Reflect-metadata shim is required to make the type of reflection work. We
   must ensure that it is imported at the top of our entry file (before we
   use/import type-graphql or any of our resolvers)

```bash
import “reflect-metadata”
```

1. Add typegoose for schema definitions.

```bash
yarn add typegoose
```

1. Typescript configuration: It’s important to set these options in the
   tsconfig.json. TypeGraphQL uses decorators and decorators are a stage 2
   proposal for Javascript and are available as an experimental feature for
   Typescript.

```json
{
  "compileOptions": {
		"emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
		"experimentalDecorators": true,
}
```

1. TypeGraphQL is designed to work with Node.js LTS and the latest stable
   releases. It uses features from ES2018 so we should set our `tsconfig.json`
   file appropriately.

```json
{
  "target": "es2018" // or newer if your node.js version supports this
}
```

For optional configurations, you can check out the installation page of
TypeGraphQL [here](https://typegraphql.com/docs/installation.html).

## **Usage**

Following is the definition that takes care of all the three types/schemas i.e.
Mongoose Schema, Typescript interface and GraphQL type definition.

```tsx
// ================ UserType.ts ================
// Libraries
import {Field, ObjectType} from 'type-graphql';
import {prop as Property, getModelForClass} from '@typegoose/typegoose';
import {ObjectId} from 'mongodb';

// Models
import {ArticleModel} from './Article.ts';

@ObjectType({description: 'The User Model'})
export class User {
  @Field(type => ID)
  readonly _id: ObjectId;

  @Property({required: true})
  @Field({description: 'Name of the user'})
  name: string;

  @Property({required: true, unique: true})
  @Field()
  email: string;

  @Property({required: false, default: generateUserName()})
  @Field({nullable: true})
  username?: string;

  @Property({required: true})
  password: string;

  @Property({required: false, default: []})
  @Field(type => [string], {name: 'articleIds'})
  articles: string[];

  @Field(type => [Article])
  get articles(): Article[] {
    return this.articles.map(
      async articleId => await ArticleModel.findById(articleId),
    );
  }
}

export const UserModel = getModelForClass(User);
```

## **Description**

What exactly is going on here? That might be your question. Worry not! At first,
this syntax feels a bit janky and uneasy but once you get to know what each line
of code here represents, it becomes easy to understand the code.

TypeGraphQL uses classes and decorators for the definition of the types. The
main reason for doing so is that Typescript has interfaces that are nothing but
classes. You can find more about
decorators [here](https://medium.com/google-developers/exploring-es7-decorators-76ecb65fb841).

- To start with, we decorate the class with the `@ObjectType` decorator which
  marks the class as the type known from the GraphQL SDL or GraphQLObjectType.
- The name given to the class is also the name of the Typescript Interface and
  Mongoose Schema.
- Each property of the object is then defined in the class
  using `@Field` and `@prop` decorators. (Note: Here I have renamed the prop
  decorator to Property at the time of import for consistency.)
- `@Field` decorator imported from `type-graphql` is used to define a GraphQL
  Field and the arguments passed to this would configure the graphql field.
- `@prop` decorator imported from `typegoose` is used to specify the individual
  properties that we use to define a field in the mongoose schema.
- Below each field, a variable and its type are defined as per a Typescript
  interface. These variables can then be used anywhere in the class.
- `@Field` takes in 2 parameters, one that defines the type of the GraphQL field
  and the second an object that configures this particular field.
- In the first property i.e. \_id, we pass a function to `@Field` whose return
  type is the ID (ID here corresponds to GraphQLID or ID from GraphQL).
- The reason for using a function to define the type of the field instead of
  having a property in an object is to avoid circular dependency.
- In the second property i.e. name, we pass a configuration object
  to `@Field` which sets the description of that particular field.
- The `password`, `articles` and `get articles()` fields are a bit strange
  looking.
- Password is one such field that we want to store in the database but doesn't
  want to resolve in a GraphQL query. For this to happen, we don't decorate this
  property with the `@Field` decorator and just add the `@prop`.
- As per our MongoDB schema, the article is an array of article ids. The idea is
  that we wish to resolve this and return an array of articles instead of just
  article IDs.
- To achieve this, we pass in a configuration property called `name` to
  the `@Field`. What it does is, the name of the GraphQL field will be set to
  whatever we configure(here it is articleIds). And within the class and the
  schema, it'll store as articles (as we want it).
- The final field is the `get articles()` one. As you can see we haven't used
  the `@prop` decorator which means that this field will not be created in the
  mongoose schema.
- This part of the code creates a GraphQL field which will be resolved as per
  the function that we have specified. In this case, we are mapping over the
  article ids (this.articles) and finding each article from the Database and
  returning an array of articles.

That covers most of the ways how we'll define our types. It's just one class
that takes care of MongoDB Schema, Typescript interface, GraphQL Type. You can
create a similar ObjectType for Article as well. Once types are defined the next
steps are Queries and Mutations. Following is an example of how we are going to
define them.

```tsx
// ================ UserResolver.ts ================
// Libraries
import {
  Resolver,
  Query,
  Arg,
  Ctx,
  Mutation,
  InputType
} from 'type-graphql';

// Types
import { UserType, UserModel } from './User';

// Input Type
@InputType()
export class userInputType {
  @Field()
  name: string;

  @Field()
  email: string;

  @Field({nullable: true})
  username?: string

  @Field()
  password: string
}

@Resolver((of) => UserType)
export class UserResolver {
  @Query((returns) => [User], { description: "Returns an array of all Users"  })
  async getUsers(): Promise<User[]> {
    return await UserModel.find({});
  }

  @Query((returns) => User, { nullable: true })
  async getUserById(@Args('id') id: string): Promise<User | undefined> {
    return await UserModel.findById(id)
  }

  @Mutation((returns) => User)
  async addUser(
    @Arg("name") name: string,
    @Arg("email") email: string,
    @Arg("username") username?: string,
    @Arg("password") password: string,
  ): Promise<User | Error> {
    const existingUser = await UserModel.find({email})
    if (existingUser) throw new Error('User already Exists')

    const newUser = new UserModel({
      name,
      email,
      username,
      password: hashPassword(password),
      articles: []
    })
    return await newUser.save();
  }

  @Mutation((returns) => User)
  async updateUser(
    @Arg("user") userInput: userInputType
    @Ctx() ctx: Context,
  ): Promise<User | Error> {
    if (!ctx.user) throw new Error("User not authorized.")

    return await UserModel.findOneAndUpdate({email}, userInput)
  }

  @Mutation((returns) => boolean)
  async deleteUser(
    @Arg("id") id: ID,
    @Ctx() ctx: Context,
  ): Promise<boolean | Error> {
    if (!ctx.user) throw new Error("User not authorized")

    await UserModel.findByIdAndDelete(id)
    return true,
  }
}
```

## **Description**

Here we go again! But this time you might be having some insights as to what is
happening. Lets get to the breakdown.

- Just like object definitions, type-graphql provides us with decorators to
  describe the various properties. Let's start with the UserResolver. (We'll
  come back to the UserInputType later)
- UserResolver is a class that contains all the queries and mutations related to
  the user. Unlike the object type definition, here the name doesn't signify
  much and can be considered as a housing for the queries and mutation (you'll
  see later why)
- We have our first query called getUsers decorated by the `@Query` decorator
  which returns an array of Users. The Query can be configured through the
  configuration object as shown.
- In the second one, we see that we are getting input from the client. This is
  implemented using the `@Args` decorator. The syntax is a bit tricky but
  visualising it as follows might help you understand it.

```tsx
getUserById(
  @Args('id')
  id: string,
): Promise<User | undefined>
```

- Just like the `@Field` decorator, we add the `@Args` decorator before every
  argument.
- The next one we have is the addUser Mutation which is decorated by
  the `@Mutation`. All of these decorators follow the same pattern. Here we are
  getting multiple arguments, checking for existing users, creating a new one
  and returning it.
- The updateUser mutation is a bit different. Here we are getting an object with
  the required arguments as input objects instead of each argument. This is why
  we defined a class above called UserInputType with the possible arguments as
  fields.
- We also get access to the Context object using the `@Ctx` decorator which we
  then can use to perform our authorization checks.
- The last one is a good old deleteUser mutation which then completes all our
  CRUD operations.

## **Bringing it all together.**

Now we have our entire schema, types, mutations and queries all set up. The
final step is to build the graphql schema and configure apollo-server.

```tsx
import {ApolloServer} from 'apollo-server';
import {buildSchema} from 'type-graphql';
import {UserResolver} from './schema/UserResolver';

const init = async () => {
  /* Code to initialize MongoDB */

  // Build type-graphql executable schema
  const schema = await buildSchema({
    resolvers: [UserResolver],
  });

  // Initialize Apollo Server
  const server = new ApolloServer({schema});

  // Listen to the server
  const {url} = await server.listen(4000);
  console.log(`Server is running, GraphQL playground available at ${url}`);
};

init();
```

## **Conclusion**

While TypeGraphQL has a rather steep learning curve and can look janky in the
beginning, I assure you that maintaining the project, in the long run, is going
to be effortless. Having a single source of truth also avoids code repetition
and moreover prevents any sort of error while developing. TypeGraphQL along with
a supporting library works like a charm. One thing to note, though the article
showcases the benefits of using TypeGraphQL and Typegoose together, it doesn't
mean that you can't use them separately. Depending upon your requirements, you
may use either of the tools or a combination of them. (Another popular library
is TypeORM)

The article covers a relatively basic setup with all CRUD operations. You can

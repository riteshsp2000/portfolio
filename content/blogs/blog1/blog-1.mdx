## Introduction

You may have noticed your Facebook friend's fancy profile pictures with the
frame of the sports team they support or a colleague's LinkedIn profile with a
frame about openness to work. Yes, this is exactly what you'll be building! With
a high level of customisation, you can easily build one for your online events
for all the participants to use. Here's a quick glance to what we'll be
building.

![HackNITR Frameboi](https://res.cloudinary.com/riteshp2000/image/upload/v1638708391/portfolio/v2/Screenshot_2021-12-02_at_6.22.40_PM_1_u2vazy.webp)

HTML5 Canvas is a powerful tool for incorporating dynamic, performant visuals in
web apps. It supports a wide range of browsers and includes built-in APIs for
drawing shapes, pictures, and text. A variety of utility libraries, such as
`Konva.js`, `p5.js`, have been created on top of Canvas to assist with event
handling and animations.

I choose `konva.js` over the many other canvas libraries available. The Canvas
API is essentially imperative, and it was built to interact with vanilla
javascript with methods like `ctx.rect(x, y, width, height)`. This syntax is
completely alien to React Developers and is unsuitable with modern React
Patterns. `react-konva`, a react wrapper for `konva.js` allows you to use React
component interfaces to connect with the Konva API

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, this article assumes that you are familiar with the following
concepts.

- Familiarity with React and its basic usage. You can check out
  [getting started with Create React App](https://blog.logrocket.com/getting-started-with-create-react-app-d93147444a27/)
  to brush up on your React skills before we start.
- Understanding of a state management tool such as `Redux` or `Context API`.
  This guide on
  [using redux in react apps](https://blog.logrocket.com/why-use-redux-reasons-with-clear-examples-d21bffd5835/)
  will get you covered. Alternatively, you can also check out this guide on
  [How to use React Context effectively](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-use-react-context-effectively)
- Prior knowledge about `react-konva` would be beneficial. You can take a look
  at this guide to
  [canvas manipulation using react-konva](https://blog.logrocket.com/canvas-manipulation-react-konva/)
- Here is a look at all the technologies and libraries we'll be using

  `react` `create-react-app` `styled-components` `react Context API`
  `react-konva` `netlify`

## Project Setup

1. Install `yarn`. Yarn is a package manager just like `npm` but faster. Using
   `yarn` would make your development process much smoother.

   ```bash
   # Globally install yarn
   npm install -g yarn
   ```

1. Create a basic react app using CRA. To run this command, you need to have
   `node.js` installed which you can check if you have Node using the command
   `node --version`. You can find the links to
   [download on Node.js's website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Installing
   `node.js` will automatically enable the `npm` and `npx` commands.

   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npx create-react-app profile-frames

   # Using yarn
   yarn create react-app profile-frames

   ```

1. Setting up a clean directory structure. Delete all the files that come with
   CRA and create the required folders and files as shown below.

   - public - files in this directory will be directly accessible to the users.
   - src - contains all the files which we add and use.
   - assets - all the images and frames we'll be using would be here.
   - components - contains all the various components that we'll be having
   - pages - all the different screens that we'll be having
   - store - files handling the global state management of the app.

1. Running your React app. Create an `index.js` and `App.jsx` files in the src
   directory and add the following code.

   ```jsx
   // App.jsx
   import React from 'react';

   const App = () => {
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>Hello World</h1>
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default App;

   // index.js
   import React from 'react';
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

   import App from './App';

   ReactDOM.render(
     <React.StrictMode>
       <App />
     </React.StrictMode>,
     document.querySelector('#root'),
   );
   ```

1. Installing the required packages and libraries. We will be using
   `styled-components` for css styling and `react-konva` for canvas
   manipulations

   ```jsx
   yarn add styled-components react-konva konva
   ```

## List of Features

Before you begin coding, you must first make a detailed list of the features we
intend to include, based on which you would build your components. The features
you'll be implementing are listed below.

- A stage where the user can interact with different Konva elements
- A carousel which consists of various frame options to choose from
- Control panel consisting of
  - An upload image button
  - Name and Guild inputs
  - A Download button

Depending upon the above list of required features, the following is a component
architecture that that would be suitable for the project.

> styling and css. You can find the details of specific implementation in the
> repository linked below.

## Let's get building...

### Step 1: Creating the Canvas component

- So, how react-konva works is that it has a component called Stage that you can
  use to render various canvas shapes and items.
- The immediate child component of `Stage` needs to be a `Layer` component. A
  layer can then house different components such as images, texts, shapes, etc.
  In this case, just a single layer would do the job great.
- Create a new file named Canvas.jsx in the components directory and add the
  following code.

```jsx
import React, {useRef} from 'react';

// Libraries
import {Layer, Stage, Image, Text} from 'react-konva';

// Assets
import frame1 from '../assets/frame1';
import profile from '../assets/frame1';

const Canvas = () => {
  /**
   * A list of variables containing the various details that we
   * would require for all the different elements.
   *
   * It is better to separate them now as we will be shifting
   * them to their global states later
   */
  const stageRef = useRef();
  const stageDetails = {
    width: 350,
    height: 350,
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
  };

  const imageDetails = {
    originalDimensions: {
      width: 0,
      height: 0,
    },
    renderDimensions: {
      width: 300,
      height: 300,
    },
    position: {
      x: 0,
      y: 0,
    },
  };

  const textDetails = {
    name: {
      value: 'name field',
      id: 'user-name',
      dimensions: {
        width: 100,
        height: 50,
      },
      position: {
        x: 50,
        y: 50,
      },
    },
    guild: {
      value: 'guild field',
      id: 'user-guild',
      dimensions: {
        x: 100,
        y: 50,
      },
      position: {
        x: 100,
        y: 100,
      },
    },
  };

  return (
    <Stage
      ref={stageRef}
      width={stageDetails.width}
      height={stageDetails.height}
      style={{position: 'relative'}}
    >
      <Layer>
        <Image
          image={profile}
          width={imageDetails.renderDimensions.width}
          height={imageDetails.renderDimensions.height}
          x={imageDetails.position.x}
          y={imageDetails.position.y}
        />

        <Text
          text={textDetails.name.value}
          width={textDetails.name.dimensions.width}
          height={textDetails.name.dimensions.height}
          x={textDetails.name.position.x}
          y={textDetails.name.position.y}
        />
        <Text
          text={textDetails.guild.value}
          width={textDetails.guild.dimensions.width}
          height={textDetails.guild.dimensions.height}
          x={textDetails.guild.position.x}
          y={textDetails.guild.position.y}
        />

        <Image
          image={frame1}
          width={stageDetails.width}
          height={stageDetails.height}
          x={0}
          y={0}
          style={{position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, zIndex: 100}}
        />
      </Layer>
    </Stage>
  );
};

export default Canvas;
```

- As you can see, quite a few things are going on here. Most of them are pretty
  straightforward but let's get started with the different props that are being
  passed to all the elements.
- Each canvas element takes the following props
  - width and height specifying the dimensions of the particular component
  - x and y specifying the position of the component. Here x and y are relative
    to the stage component and start from the top-left corner of the stage.
- The Stage component requires a reference which is created using the useRef
  hook.
- There are 2 Image components, one for the profile picture and the other for
  the frame. Since these images can be of high resolution, we need to calculate
  the render dimensions for each image to fit it inside the stage (which will be
  done as we proceed ahead)
- Additionally, there are 2 Text components as well. It has a text prop that
  renders the content i.e. the text we provide
- At this point, you would be having the Stage ready, but if you see, there are
  a few issues going on.
  1. The text appearing doesn't have a background. It needs to be fixed so that
     it looks distinct from the images.
  2. None of the elements is transformable, as in neither their sizes can be
     changed nor can they be rotated.
  3. Finally, everything at this point is static, the app needs to be made
     dynamic.

### Step 2: Creating a custom Text component.

- The issue with the inbuilt Text component is that it doesn't have a
  background. Silly, but it is what it is.
- Instead, what you'll be doing is creating a custom component using a Text
  component placed on top of a Rect Component (Rectangle). In order to achieve
  this, react-konva provides a group component so that a single set of props
  such as dimensions and positions are provided just to one component instead of
  multiple.
- Create a new file - CustomText.jsx and add the following code.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

// Libraries
import {Rect, Text, Group} from 'react-konva';

const CustomText = ({dimensions, position, name}) => {
  const shapeRef = React.useRef(null);

  /**
   * As with other konva components, group also takes in
   * width, height and positions x and y.
   *
   * In addition to this, the properities of offsetX and offsetY
   * prop which shifts its coordinate system origin to the center instead
   * of the top-left corner are also added.
   *
   * This would help in positioning both the rectangle and the
   * text element at the center of the group.
   */
  const groupProps = {
    width: dimensions.width,
    height: dimensions.height,
    offsetX: dimensions.width / 2,
    offsetY: dimensions.height / 2,
    x: position.x,
    y: position.y,
  };

  return (
    <Group ref={shapeRef} {...groupProps}>
      {/* The width of both the elements are kept same */}
      {/* Not passing any positions defaults them to x=0 and y=0 */}
      <Rect
        width={dimensions.width}
        height={dimensions.height}
        cornerRadius={[7, 7, 7, 7]}
        fill="lightblue"
      />
      <Text
        width={dimensions.width}
        height={dimensions.height}
        align="center"
        verticalAlign="middle"
        text={name}
        fontSize={20}
      />
    </Group>
  );
};

export default CustomText;
```

- Here you go! A custom Text component that is way more legible and can be
  easily distinguished from the background image is ready.

### Step 3: Scale your components with Transformer

- So far you have gotten the majority of the components ready with a key feature
  missing which would add a new level of customisation to your application.
  Let's start with Images. Before you create your custom image component, you
  need to refactor the canvas component to have some states since we are
  shifting to a more dynamic application with interactions.

```jsx
import profile from '../assets/frame1';

const Canvas = () => {
  /* Existing Code */

  /**
   * Okay so the imageDetails variables are removed and
   * shifted to a state. Not only this but also 2 new properties of
   * scale defaulted to 1 which would determine
   * the size of our shape/element and id are added
   *
   * In addition to that, a new state called selectedElement is also
   * selectedElement. This element stores an id or unique field which
   * showcases which element is currently selected.
   */
  const [selectedElement, setSelectedElement] = useState(null);
  const [imageDetails, setImageDetails] = useState({
    originalDimensions: {
      width: 0,
      height: 0,
    },
    renderDimensions: {
      width: 300,
      height: 300,
    },
    position: {
      x: 0,
      y: 0,
    },
    scale: 1,
    id: 'user-profile-image',
    image: profile,
  });

  /* Existing code */
};

export default Canvas;
```

- Now that you have set up your stage with states, time to build a transformable
  image component. To reduce the code in a single component and avoid any sort
  of repetition, create a new file named `CustomImage.jsx`
- `react-konva` has a Transformer component that creates a box around the shape
  using which the user can resize or rotate the shape. Add the following code to
  the above-mentioned file.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

// Components
import {Image, Transformer} from 'react-konva';

const CustomImage = ({imageDetails, setImageDetails, isSelected, onSelect}) => {
  /**
   * Create references to the shape which needs to be transformed
   * and to the transformer component itself.
   */
  const shapeRef = React.useRef();
  const transformerRef = React.useRef();

  /**
   * This effect runs whenever the isSelected variable is toggled
   * The isSelected variable is set from the parent element which indicates
   * that the current element is selected and is to be transformed.
   */
  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (isSelected) {
      /**
       * Here you are instructing the transformer component via its ref to
       * enable the specified component i.e. the image is to be transformed
       * and then create the transformer box around it.
       * This code will run everytime the isSelected variable is updated.
       */
      transformerRef.current?.nodes([shapeRef.current]);
      transformerRef.current?.getLayer().batchDraw();
    }
  }, [isSelected]);

  const {
    renderDimensions: {width, height},
    position: {x, y},
    image,
  } = imageDetails;

  /**
   * The most important handler functions for transformations
   * You need to handle 2 things -
   *    Change in Dimensions on transform and
   *    Change in Positions on drag
   */

  /**
   * This function handles the dimension changes of the shape
   * If you recall, you have set a property named scale equal to 1 on
   * initialisation.
   * Using this handler, you need to update the scale property of this
   * shape which can be obtained from the shapeRef
   */
  const onTransformEnd = () => {
    if (shapeRef.current) {
      const node = shapeRef.current;
      setImageDetails(current => ({...current, scale: node.scale()}));
    }
  };

  /**
   * This function handles the positional changes of the shape
   * You have positions (x and y) properties in the state which you
   * will update through this handler, similar to the onTransformEnd
   * function.
   */
  const onDragEnd = () => {
    if (shapeRef.current) {
      const node = shapeRef.current;
      setImageDetails(current => ({...current, x: node.x(), y: node.y()}));
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Image
        ref={shapeRef}
        image={image}
        width={width}
        height={height}
        x={x}
        y={y}
        /**
        onSelect is a function that toggles the isSelected
        variable. This function is called when image is
        clicked or tapped.
        */
        onClick={onSelect}
        onTap={onSelect}
        /** Transformation Handlers Explained above */
        onTransformEnd={onTransformEnd}
        onDragEnd={onDragEnd}
      />

      {isSelected && (
        <Transformer
          ref={transformerRef}
          boundBoxFunc={(oldBox, newBox) => {
            /**
              this function handles the sizing of the box
              Essentially what it does is adding a check
              to avoid reduction of size to 0
              if the newBox dimensions are less than 5 units,
              it returns the oldBox dimensions
             */
            if (newBox.width < 5 || newBox.height < 5) {
              return oldBox;
            }
            return newBox;
          }}
        />
      )}
    </>
  );
};

export default CustomImage;
```

- Okay, you have a transformable image component all set up, time to update the
  canvas stage with the new component. In the `Canvas.jsx` file, replace the
  Image component with the following code.

  NOTE: Replace only the Image component used for the user profile image as you
  don't want the frame to be transformable.

```jsx
<CustomImage
  imageDetails={imageDetails}
  setImageDetails={setImageDetails}
  isSelected={selectedElement === imageDetails.id}
  onSelect={() => setSelectedElement(imageDetails.id)}
/>
```

- Yay! You got your image to be transformable! Images down, texts to go!
  Similarly, refactor the CustomText component to make them transformable.

### Step 4: Time to refactor

- As you can see, in the current setup you have quite a lot of state-related
  items such as image details, text details, stage details etc in the component
  itself. Additionally, you also have all sorts of handler functions in the same
  component. Quickly the code will start growing and become unreadable.
- In addition to this, you can see that with just 3 components, there is a lot
  of prop drilling going on which is not at all a good practice. There are a few
  states here that need to be uplifted since components such as the inputs and
  upload button require them.
- Time to set up global state management. You will be using the Context API
  along with the useReducer hook. I believe that at its core React is a state
  management library and hence any external libraries such as Redux are not
  necessary.

  > [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com) has a phenomenal article explaining
  > the
  > [Context API and useReducer pattern for state management](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-use-react-context-effectively).

- Under the `store/actions` directory, create a new file - `frames.action.js`
  and add the following code.

```jsx
/**
 * the useReducer hook from react takes the initialState as
 * one of its parameters. If no param is passed, the initial state
 * would be considered as null which not necessarily wrong but not at
 * all a better practice. It can lead to unknown undefined errors during
 * build time.
 * As defined below, this is the initial state structure considering all
 * the required fields related to the user profile image.
 */
export const initialState = {
  imageDetails: {
    originalDimensions: {
      width: 0,
      height: 0,
    },
    renderDimensions: {
      width: 0,
      height: 0,
    },
    position: {
      x: 0,
      y: 0,
    },
    scale: 1,
    id: 'user-profile-image',
    image: null,
  },
};

/**
 * Similar to redux, define all the different types of
 * actions related to image state changes to avoid any errors down
 * the line.
 */
export const CANVAS_ACTIONS = Object.freeze({
  UPLOAD_IMAGE: 'IMAGE/UPDATE_IMAGE_DETAILS',
  UPDATE_IMAGE_DIMENSIONS: 'IMAGE/UPDATE_IMAGE_RENDER_DIMENSIONS',
  UPDATE_IMAGE_POSITION: 'IMAGE/UPDATE_IMAGE_POSITIONS',
});
```

- Now that you have our action types and initial state set up, let's set the
  reducer for the same as well. Create a file - `frames.reducer.js` under the
  `store/reducers` directory and add the following code.

```jsx
import {CANVAS_ACTIONS} from '../actions/compose.action';

/**
 * Similar to Redux, canvasReducer handles all the different
 * actions and the changes to be made to the state depending
 * on the action type.
 *
 * For now, each case returns the default state. You'll start
 * writing cases after the context API is setup
 */
export default function canvasReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case CANVAS_ACTIONS.UPLOAD_IMAGE:
      return state;

    case CANVAS_ACTIONS.UPDATE_IMAGE_DIMENSIONS:
      return state;

    case CANVAS_ACTIONS.UPDATE_IMAGE_POSITIONS:
      return state;

    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

- Props are used to send data top-down (parent to child) in a standard React
  application, but this might be inconvenient for certain sorts of props that
  are required by multiple components within an application. The Context API
  makes it possible to share values like these between components without having
  to pass a prop through each level of the tree explicitly.
- Create a new file - `canvas.context.js` under the `store/contexts` directory
  and add the following code.

```jsx
import React, {useReducer, useMemo, createContext, useContext} from 'react';

// Reducer, Initial State, Types
import canvasReducer from '../reducers/frames.reducer';
import {initialState} from '../actions/frames.action';

/**
 * use the createContext function from react to create a context component
 */
const FramesContext = createContext(initialState);

export function FramesCtxProvider(props) {
  /**
   * The useReducer hook provided by React enables you to create
   * global states. Similar to the useState hook, useReducer provides
   * access to the state through is first destructured variable and a
   * function - dispatch to which you pass an object consisting of 2 properites -
   *
   * dispatch({
   * 	type: one of the types from CANVAS_ACTIONS,
   * 	payload: data that would be sent to reducer function to update the state,
   * })
   */
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(canvasReducer, initialState);
  const value = useMemo(() => [state, dispatch], [state]);
  return <FramesContext.Provider value={value} {...props} />;
}

/**
 * A very handy custom hook to easily get access to the state and dispatch functions
 * in any component
 *
 * This avoids quite a few steps where you would have to import the above context,
 * useContext hook from react and bunch of other steps.
 *
 * Instead, all you have to do now is import this hook and call it inside a component!
 */
export function useFrames() {
  const context = useContext(FramesContext);
  if (!context)
    throw new Error('useFrames must be used within a FramesCtxProvider');

  const [state, dispatch] = context;
  return [state, dispatch];
}
```

- Before you proceed with reducers, you need to wrap your Application with this
  context provider. Head to `App.jsx` and update the code with the following
  code.

```jsx
import React from "react";

// Components
import { FramesCtxProvider } from "./store/contexts/frames.context";
import Frames from "./pages/Frame";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <FramesCtxProvider>
      <Frames />
    </FramesCtxProvider>
  );
};

export default App;

/* ==================== Inside pages/Frames.jsx ==================== */
import React from "react";

// Components
import Canvas from "../components/Canvas";

const Frames = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Canvas />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Frames;
```

- You are all set, with a few final things remaining. You need to update your
  reducer function to handle the different updates and call the dispatch
  function with the appropriate action types. Refactor the `frames.reducer.js`
  file with the following code.

```jsx
export default function canvasReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case CANVAS_ACTIONS.UPLOAD_IMAGE:
      return {
        ...state,
        originalDimensions: {
          width: action.payload.width,
          height: action.payload.height,
        },
        image: action.payload.image,
      };

    case CANVAS_ACTIONS.UPDATE_IMAGE_DIMENSIONS:
      return {
        ...state,
        scale: action.payload.scale,
      };

    case CANVAS_ACTIONS.UPDATE_IMAGE_POSITIONS:
      return {
        ...state,
        position: {
          x: action.payload.x,
          y: action.payload.y,
        },
      };

    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Updating the components to use dispatch.

- Back to the Image component, we need to update 2 things
  - Image scale when onTransformEnd triggers
  - Image positions when onDragEnd triggers
  - The other thing is update the image details when an image is uploaded which
    will be done later

```jsx
// State Handlers
import {useFrames} from '../store/contexts/frames.context';
import {CANVAS_ACTIONS} from '../store/actions/frames.action';

/* Remove the rest of the destructured props */
const CustomImage = ({isSelected, onSelect}) => {
  /* Rest of code */

  const [state, dispatch] = useFrames();

  /* Update the destructured element to use the state */
  const {
    renderDimensions: {width, height},
    position: {x, y},
    image,
  } = state.imageDetails;

  /* Replace the setImageDetails with the following dispatch code */
  const onTransformEnd = () => {
    if (shapeRef.current) {
      const node = shapeRef.current;
      dispatch({
        type: CANVAS_ACTIONS.UPDATE_IMAGE_DIMENSIONS,
        payload: {
          scale: node.scale(),
        },
      });
    }
  };

  /* Replace the setImageDetails with the following dispatch code */
  const onDragEnd = () => {
    if (shapeRef.current) {
      const node = shapeRef.current;
      dispatch({
        type: CANVAS_ACTIONS.UPDATE_IMAGE_POSITIONS,
        payload: {
          x: node.x(),
          y: node.y(),
        },
      });
    }
  };

  /* Rest of code */
};
```

- That's it, you have successfully set up all the functions related to the
  profile image with the final step of uploading the image remaining.

### Step 6: Create an upload image component.

- A fairly simple component with an input of type image and an onChange handler
  with the dispatch function of type upload image. Create a file -
  `UploadImage.jsx` in the components directory.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

// State Handlers
import {CANVAS_ACTIONS} from '../store/actions/frames.action';
import {useFrames} from '../store/contexts/frames.context';

const UploadImage = () => {
  /**
   * Following is a destructuring way to get only dispatch
   */
  const [, dispatch] = useFrames();

  const handleInputChange = e => {
    /**
     * The following code is to get the image data and
     * the dimensions of the uploaded image. In order to get this
     * use the FileReader class.
     */
    if (e.target.files.length > 0) {
      const file = e.target.files[0];
      const i = new Image();
      i.src = URL.createObjectURL(file);

      i.onload = () => {
        const reader = new FileReader();
        reader.readAsDataURL(file);
        reader.onload = () => {
          dispatch({
            type: CANVAS_ACTIONS.UPLOAD_IMAGE,
            payload: {
              image: i.src,
              originalDimensions: {
                width: i.width,
                height: i.height,
              },
            },
          });
        };
      };
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <label htmlFor="contained-button-file">
        <button>Upload Image</button>
      </label>

      <input
        type="file"
        accept="image/*"
        style={{display: 'none'}}
        id="contained-button-file"
        maxFiles={1}
        onChange={handleInputChange}
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default UploadImage;
```

- Okay so you have the upload functionality ready but now you have another small
  problem to deal with. As of now, you have hardcoded the dimensions of the
  CustomImage component which is wrong. What if the uploaded image is of an
  aspect ratio other than 1:1?
- This exact reason is why the renderedDimensions property is in the image
  initial state. This exact reason is why you are also getting the original
  dimensions of the image at the time of upload
- What you are going to do is calculate the aspect ratio of the image, and
  depending on the size of the stage calculate the rendered dimensions of the
  image. Add the following code to the handleImageInput function right after the
  first dispatch.

```jsx
const aspectRatio = i.width / i.height;
const stageHeight = state.stageDetails.height;
const stageWidth = state.stageDetails.width;
dispatch({
  type: CANVAS_ACTIONS.UPDATE_IMAGE_RENDERED_DIMENSIONS,
  payload: {
    width: aspectRatio > 1 ? stageWidth : stageHeight * aspectRatio,
    height: aspectRatio > 1 ? stageWidth / aspectRatio : stageHeight,
  },
});
```

### Step 6 - Downloading the frames and other final steps.

- Converting the canvas to the image isn't a big deal. `react-konva` provides a
  method to do so via the reference that we passed to the Stage component.

```jsx
const downloadURI = (uri, name) => {
  const link = document.createElement('a');
  link.download = name;
  link.href = uri;
  document.body.appendChild(link);
  link.click();
  document.body.removeChild(link);
};

const handleDownload = () => {
  if (stageRef.current) {
    const uri = stageRef.current.toDataURL();
    downloadURI(uri, 'certificate.png');
  }
};
```

- Proceeding ahead, you need to get the input components ready and show the
  value in the text component of the stage (the CustomText component). The
  methodology for achieving this is exactly the same that you did for the
  images. Here is a recap of how to get it done.

## Conclusion.

Through this article, you were able to create a React and React Konva project
with a sophisticated state management pattern without using any external
packages. You learned how to set up a canvas environment and how to manipulate
different aspects of a canvas in a React based single page application. From
here, you can integrate the various other react-konva components to make your
project more interactive.

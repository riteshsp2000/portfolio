## The Modern React way

React has undergone significant modifications in the previous three years, resulting in significant changes in the way React apps are built.
The most significant modifications are the Functional Component Pattern and
Hooks. Hooks are the newest trend in the React community and are inevitable for
any React Developer

In this article, you will be able to create custom hooks that can be frequently
used and can cut down on a lot of boilerplate code. Before that, let's look into
what exactly are hooks.

![Custom React Hooks](https://res.cloudinary.com/riteshp2000/image/upload/v1638812997/portfolio/v2/blogs/blog-2/Things-You-Should-Know-About-React-Hooks_slwxim_nj4ezm.webp)

## React Hooks

React Hooks was first suggested in October 2018 and then published four months
later in February 2019. Hooks have been swiftly learned and adopted in
production codebases since then because they greatly simplify the handling of
state and side effects in applications.

Before React 16.8, implementing states and life cycle methods in a functional
component was not possible. The introduction of hooks made this possible. Hooks
are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from
functional components. Following are a few inbuilt hooks provided by React.

- useState: as suggested by the name, it is used for states in a functional
  component
- useEffect: used for implementing life cycle methods
- useContext: a useful hook that helps prevent props drilling
- useRef: specifically used for references in JSX (has additional use cases as
  well)
- useReducer: an implementation of redux state management with hooks.
  (alternative to useState)

These are a few of the inbuilt hooks, React has more to offer. For in-depth
details about these hooks, you can check the
[official documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html). For
video enthusiasts, you can check out the hooks
[playlist by Ben Awad](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN3n1USn4xlmyw3ebYuZmGp60mcENitdM).

## Custom Hooks

As projects develop, the likelihood of a specific piece of code recurring
increases dramatically. In such cases, it's always a good idea to abstract the
logic of these components into bespoke utils. Custom hooks are used in frontend
react apps when state and life cycle methods are required to implement the
abstraction logic.

Before we look into some of the useful custom hooks, it is necessary that you
understand why hooks are really important and also understand a few rules
related to hooks while using them.

You might have heard of [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/), he is a big
deal in React and his [blog](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/) is one of the most
revered blogs out there. Here is a direct quote from him regarding hooks.

> Hooks come with a lot of benefits, but one of my favourites is that it makes
> your components more declarative in that it allows you to stop thinking about
> "when things should happen in the lifecycle of the component" (which doesn't
> matter all that much) and more about "when things should happen in relation to
> state changes" (which matters much more).

In short, what he means to say is, lifecycle methods should occur as per the
changes in the state, and as we think about it, it does make sense. And hence
understanding hooks is a big step in the journey of learning React.

With this said, here are a few rules that one needs to follow while using hooks.
These are important and would be needed as we go on building our own custom
hooks.

1. **Call hooks only on top-level:**

   Hooks cannot be called inside conditionals, loops or nested functions in a
   component. Make sure you're using the hook at the top level of your
   functional components at all times.

2. **Call hooks from React functions:**

   Hooks should be called from the React functional component, or from our
   custom hooks. Hooks should never be called from a javascript function.

3. **Order of hooks:**

   React relies on the order in which hooks are called, so make sure they're in
   the right order as per your functionality/requirement.

With this said, let's look into a few custom hooks that I use in my projects to
make things easier for me.

1. useInput

   ```jsx
   import {useState} from 'react';

   export const useInput = initialState => {
     const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);

     const set = event => setState(event.target.value);
     const reset = () => setState(initialState);

     return [state, set, reset];
   };
   ```

   - A really useful hook for keeping track of your inputs. The hook accepts an
     initial state parameter and returns an array of handlers, as seen above.
   - The state variable is the one that keeps track of the input value. The set
     is a common onChange handler that sets the state to the value of the event
     target. The reset utility returns the input value to its original state.
   - Following is an implementation of the useInput hook.

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';

   // Utils
   import {useInput} from '../hooks';

   const App = () => {
     const [name, setName] = useInput();
     const [email, setEmail] = useInput();

     return (
       <div>
         <input value={name} onChange={setName} />
         <input value={email} onChange={setEmail} />
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default App;
   ```

2. useSwitch and useToggle

   ```jsx
   import {useState} from 'react';

   export const useSwitch = (initialState = false) => {
     const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);

     const open = () => setState(true);
     const close = () => setState(false);

     return [state, open, close];
   };

   export const useToggle = (initialState = false) => {
     const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
     const toggle = () => setState(currentState => !currentState);
     return [state, toggle, setState];
   };
   ```

   - It's a small hook, but it's quite handy. There are several occasions in
     which a boolean controls some aspect of the user interface in an
     application. useToggle and useSwitch come very handily in this situation.
   - Using the open and close functions, useSwitch changes the boolean state in
     a controlled manner, whereas useToggle toggles the current state condition.

3. useAsync

   ```jsx
   import {useEffect, useState} from 'react';

   /*
   options: {
   	executeOnMount: boolean,
   	dependencies: array
   }
   */

   const defaultOptions = {
     executeOnMount: false,
     dependencies: [],
   };

   export const useAsync = (api, options = defaultOptions) => {
     const [data, setData] = useState();
     const [error, setError] = useState(null);
     const [waiting, setWaiting] = useState(true);

     if (!api || typeof api !== 'function') {
       const message = `API not valid!`;
       throw new Error(message);
     }

     const onData = d => {
       setWaiting(false);
       setError(null);
       setData(d);
     };

     const onError = err => {
       setWaiting(false);
       setError(err);
     };

     const execute = async () => {
       if (!waiting) {
         setWaiting(true);

         try {
           const d = await api();
           onData(d);
         } catch (err) {
           onError(err);
         }
       }
     };

     useEffect(() => {
       if (options?.executeOnMount) execute();
     }, [...options?.dependencies]);

     return [data, error, waiting, execute];
   };
   ```

   - Asynchronous calls are the backbone of a web application, and if handled
     incorrectly, they can lead to catastrophic failures and bugs.
   - The useAsync hook aids in the management of an asynchronous call's three
     states: initialisation, loading, and successful fetch. The implementation
     is simple, using the onData and onError utilities to handle the various
     states and the execute function for making the API call.
   - The hook accepts a Promise function as well as an options object as input.
     The options object can be totally customised to meet the project's
     requirements. Though the two properties, executeOnMount and dependencies,
     are crucial to the hook's operation.
   - Following is an example of the implementation of the useAsync hook.

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';

   // Libraries
   import axios from 'axios';

   // Utils
   import {useAsync} from '../hooks';

   const App = () => {
     const fetchData = axios.get('https://api.yourdomain.com/users');
     const [data, error, waiting] = useAsync(fetchData, {executeOnMount: true});

     if (waiting) {
       return <h1>Loading...</h1>;
     }

     return <div>{error && !data ? <h1>{error}</h1> : <h1>{data}</h1>}</div>;
   };

   export default App;
   ```

4. useEventListener

   ```jsx
   import {useEffect, useRef} from 'react';

   export const useEventListener = (eventName, handler, element = window) => {
     const eventHandler = useRef();

     useEffect(() => {
       eventHandler.current = handler;
     }, [handler]);

     useEffect(() => {
       if (!element && !element.addEventListener) return;

       element.addEventListener(eventName, event =>
         eventHandler.current(event),
       );

       return () => element.removeEventListener(eventName, eventListener);
     }, [eventName, element]);
   };
   ```

   - If you frequently use useEffect to add event listeners, you should consider
     transferring that logic to a custom hook. The following useEventListener
     hook above handles verifying if addEventListener is supported, adding the
     event listener, and removing it on cleanup.
   - useRef is a versatile hook that can be used in multiple ways. One way that
     it is used above is to prevent potential multiple re-runs on every render.
     This allows our first useEffect to always get the latest handler without
     users needing to pass it in useEffect dependencies.

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';

   // Utils
   import {useEventListener} from '../hooks';

   const App = () => {
     const element = document.querySelector('#button-id');
     const [showDate, setShowDate] = useState();

     const eventHandler = () => setShowDate(current => !current);
     useEventListener('click', handler, element);

     return (
       <div>
         <button id="#button-id">Click here for date</button>
         {showDate && <h1>{new Date().toDateString()}</h1>}
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default App;
   ```

5. useIsComponentUnmounted

   ```jsx
   import {useRef, useEffect} from 'react';

   export const useIsComponentUnmounted = () => {
     const isMounted = useRef(true);

     useEffect(() => {
       return () => (isMounted.current = false);
     }, []);

     return isMounted.current;
   };
   ```

   - Memory Leaks are one of the most frequent errors encountered by React
     Developers. A memory leak is a situation where a component tries to update
     its state when its unmounted.
   - In order to prevent such scenarios, it is always recommended to check if a
     component is mounted before updating the state. Hence the following hook. A
     very short hook though the frequency of it being used is very high.

   ```jsx
   import React, {useEffect, useState} from 'react';

   // Libraries
   import axios from 'axios';

   // Utils
   import {useIsComponentUnmounted} from './hooks';

   const App = () => {
     const [name, setName] = useState();
     const isUnmounted = useIsComponentUnmounted();

     useEffect(() => {
       if (!isUnmounted) {
         axios
           .get('https://api.yourdomain.com/getName')
           .then(data => setName(data.name))
           .catch(error => console.log(error));
       }
     }, []);

     return <h1>Hello {name}</h1>;
   };
   ```

6. useScript

   ```jsx
   import {useEffect, useState} from 'react';

   /*
   constants in order to maintain consistency
   */
   const STATUS = {
     IDLE: 'Idle',
     LOADING: 'Loading scripts',
     READY: 'Script loaded successfully',
     ERROR: 'Unable to load Script',
   };

   export const useScript = src => {
     const [status, setStatus] = useState(src ? STATUS.LOADING : STATUS.IDLE);

     // Helper function to add listeners
     const addEventListeners = (element, onChange) => {
       element.addEventListener('load', onChange);
       element.addEventListener('error', onChange);
     };

     useEffect(() => {
       // Allow falsy src value if waiting on other data needed for
       // constructing the script URL passed to this hook.
       if (!src) {
         setStatus(STATUS.ERROR);
         return;
       }
       // Fetch existing script element by src
       // It may have been added by another intance of this hook
       let script = document.querySelector(`script[src="${src}"]`);

       if (!script) {
         // Create script
         script = document.createElement('script');
         script.src = src;
         script.async = true;
         script.setAttribute('data-status', 'loading');
         // Add script to document body
         document.body.appendChild(script);
         // Store status in attribute on script
         // This can be read by other instances of this hook
         const setAttributeFromEvent = event => {
           script.setAttribute(
             'data-status',
             event.type === 'load' ? 'ready' : 'error',
           );
         };

         addEventListeners(script, setAttibuteFromEvent);
       } else {
         // Grab existing script status from attribute and set to state.
         setStatus(STATUS.LOADING);
       }
       // Script event handler to update status in state
       // Note: Even if the script already exists we still need to add
       // event handlers to update the state for *this* hook instance.
       const setStateFromEvent = event => {
         setStatus(event.type === 'load' ? STATUS.READY : STATUS.ERROR);
       };
       // Add event listeners
       addEventListeners(script, setStateFromEvent);
       // Remove event listeners on cleanup

       return () => {
         if (script) {
           script.removeEventListener('load', setStateFromEvent);
           script.removeEventListener('error', setStateFromEvent);
         }
       };
     }, [src]);

     return status;
   };
   ```

   - Even though most of the modern libraries and packages are shifting to a
     module-based system, quite a few times there are situations wherein you
     would have to use a script. In such cases, it becomes important that the
     script is properly loaded and used appropriately.
   - The useScript hook shown above keeps a track of the stages of a script
     loading in order to notify the app of its usage.
   - Along with this, it also checks for a few basic things such as if the
     script is loaded earlier (helps in preventing unnecessary loading and
     improves performance).

7. useMediaQuery

   ```jsx
   import {useState, useEffect} from 'react';

   export const useMediaQuery = query => {
     const [matches, setMatches] = useState(false);

     useEffect(() => {
       const media = window.matchMedia(query);
       if (media.matches !== matches) {
         setMatches(media.matches);
       }

       const listener = () => setMatches(media.matches);
       window.addEventListener('resize', listener);

       return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', listener);
     }, [matches, query]);

     return matches;
   };
   ```

   - Another handy hook. With applications becoming more and more dynamic,
     handling the responsiveness of an app just via CSS queries could be
     daunting.
   - With patterns where desktop and mobile components are separately created
     and rendered separately. The useMediaQuery hook helps in implementing this.
     Following is an implementation of the same.

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import {useMediaQuery} from './hooks';

   function App() {
     // You can use any @media property
     const isDesktop = useMediaQuery('(min-width: 960px)');

     return (
       <div className="App">
         {isDesktop ? <h1>Desktop</h1> : <h1>Mobile</h1>}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

8. useLocalStorage

   ```jsx
   export const useLocalStorage = (key, initialValue) => {
     const [error, setError] = useState(null);
     // State to store our value
     // Pass initial state function to useState so logic is only executed once
     const [storedValue, setStoredValue] = useState(() => {
       try {
         // Get from local storage by key and
         // parse stored json or if none return initialValue
         const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key);
         return item ? JSON.parse(item) : initialValue;
       } catch (error) {
         // If error also return initialValue
         setError({type: 'Initialisation', message: error});
         return initialValue;
       }
     });

     // ... persists the new value to localStorage.
     const setValue = value => {
       try {
         // Save to local state and to local storage
         setStoredValue(value);
         window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
       } catch (error) {
         setError({type: 'Set Value', message: error});
       }
     };

     // ... remove the persisted value from localStorage
     const removeValue = () => {
       try {
         setStoredValue(null);
         window.localStorage.removeItem(key);
       } catch (error) {
         setError({type: 'Remove Value', message: error});
       }
     };

     return [storedValue, setValue, removeValue, error];
   };
   ```

   - With the rise of state persistence for user personalisation, usage of
     localStorage has risen commendably.
   - The useLocalStorage eases our work by handling the storage and removal of
     key-value pairs in LocalStorage as well as any error occurring during the
     process.

## Conclusion

Okay! So there you go, quite a few custom hooks for you to use and experiment
around. Hooks are extremely powerful and when done right can help you to write
clean and concise code. Saying this, there are still quite a few things that you
can look into. With these examples, I hope you were able to get an idea about
how to create custom hooks and I hope that you would use these hooks in your own
projects as well.

## Introduction

You may have noticed your Facebook friend's fancy profile pictures with the
frame of the sports team they support or a colleague's LinkedIn profile with a
frame about openness to work. Yes, this is exactly what you'll be building! With
a high level of customisation, you can easily build one for your online events
for all the participants to use. Here's a quick glance to what we'll be
building.

HTML5 Canvas is a powerful tool for incorporating dynamic, performant visuals in
web apps. It supports a wide range of browsers and includes built-in APIs for
drawing shapes, pictures, and text. A variety of utility libraries, such as
`Konva.js`, `p5.js`, have been created on top of Canvas to assist with event
handling and animations.

I choose `konva.js` over the many other canvas libraries available. The Canvas
API is essentially imperative, and it was built to interact with vanilla
javascript with methods like `ctx.rect(x, y, width, height)`. This syntax is
completely alien to React Developers and is unsuitable with modern React
Patterns. `react-konva`, a react wrapper for `konva.js` allows you to use React
component interfaces to connect with the Konva API

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, this article assumes that you are familiar with the following
concepts.

- Familiarity with React and its basic usage. You can check out
  [getting started with Create React App](https://blog.logrocket.com/getting-started-with-create-react-app-d93147444a27/)
  to brush up on your React skills before we start.
- Understanding of a state management tool such as `Redux` or `Context API`.
  This guide on
  [using redux in react apps](https://blog.logrocket.com/why-use-redux-reasons-with-clear-examples-d21bffd5835/)
  will get you covered. Alternatively, you can also check out this guide on
  [How to use React Context effectively](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-use-react-context-effectively)
- Prior knowledge about `react-konva` would be beneficial. You can take a look
  at this guide to
  [canvas manipulation using react-konva](https://blog.logrocket.com/canvas-manipulation-react-konva/)
- Here is a look at all the technologies and libraries we'll be using

  `react` `create-react-app` `styled-components` `react Context API`
  `react-konva` `netlify`

1. Running your React app. Create an `index.js` and `App.jsx` files in the src
   directory and add the following code.

   ```jsx
   // App.jsx
   import React from 'react';

   const App = () => {
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>Hello World</h1>
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default App;

   // index.js
   import React from 'react';
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

   import App from './App';

   ReactDOM.render(
     <React.StrictMode>
       <App />
     </React.StrictMode>,
     document.querySelector('#root'),
   );
   ```

- On a daily basis I collaborated with a multi-disciplinary team of engineers,
  designers, and product managers as part of the PostPe Core team to develop the
  newest consumer-focused product, PostPe.
- Primarily responsible for adding new features to the React and SASS-based
  mobile application using the webview flow and a bespoke native-hand-shaker. I
  actively maintained the official website of PostPe.
- In addition, I utilized Java, Springboot, and PostgreSQL to develop APIs for new
  dashboard capabilities & features for the user support staff.
